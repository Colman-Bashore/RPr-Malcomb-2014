This tabular data is not freely available online.
The data is summarized from a series of excel workbooks provided by a contact at FEWS NET.
Each workbook corresponds to a single livelihood zone and contains three sheets: `poor`, `middle`, and `rich`.
Each sheet describes livelihoods for typical households in each of the three classes based on a focus group with stakeholders in the livelihood zone.
Data in `lhz.csv` is based on the `poor` households, and was copied from the original sheets based on relevance to the reproduction study.

The data was acquired from FEWS NET on April 5, 2021.
Please contact Dr. Joseph Holler (josephh@middlebury.edu) with any questions
