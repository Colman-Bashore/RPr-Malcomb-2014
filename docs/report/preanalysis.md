## Abstract

Malcomb, Weaver and Krakowka ([2014](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2014.01.004)) published one of the first sub-national geographic climate change vulnerability models for a developing country (1.4).
The authors intended for the study to be replicable across space (other African countries with similar data available) (7.1), time (when new suvery data is published) (4.5, 7.1), and vulnerability stimuli (7.1) for the purpose of addressing extreme vulnerability to climate change (1.3) with a model to assist in the allocation and evaluation of foreign aid (1.2).
The methodology was desgined to be "transparent and easily replicable" (2.1) in its use of "locally derived indicators and granular data" (2.1), addressing critiques of vulnerability models aimed at their uncertainty and sensitivity due to problems of scale and spatial aggregation, normative and subjective modelling decisions, and data availability, and challenges in model comparability (2.1).
The model uses household adaptive capacity data United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) (1.4, 4.1) available in 44 African countries (7.1), livelihood sensitivity data from Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWSnet) livelihood zones baseline surveys available in 23 African countries (3.6), and global physical exposure data from the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Global Risk Data Platform.

This replication study is motivated by three factors.
First, climate change impacts are increasingly severe in Africa and establishing reproducible and replicable methods for geographic vulnerability modeling may help in allocating resources for climate change adaptation and evaluating the effectiveness of climate change adaptation investments.
Second, a fully reproducible publication can be more readily replicated in new geographic, temporal, and thematic contexts, and tested for uncertainty due to data constraints and subjective modelling decisions.
Third, there is an urgent need to evaluate the reproducibility of research in human-environment and geographical sciences (HEGS) and to establish protocols and infrastructure for conducting and publishing reproduction/replication studies and reproducible research in HEGS.

In this study, we will attempt to identically reproduce the 2010 Malawi Household Resilience model and the Vulnerability to Climate Change model described in Malcomb et al (2014) using The R Project for Statistical Computing and the same data sources cited in the original publication.
We will compare our reproduction results with the orginal results using thematic maps of difference between results and the Spearman's Rho Correlation Coefficient. Additionally, we will compare reproduction results with original results for the household resilience model with a confusion matrix, and for the vulnerability model with a scatterplot.
The original study is a descriptive geographic multi-criteria analysis based on local expert opinion, and therefore has no testable hypotheses or effects.
As a reproduction study, the geographic extent and support will match the original study, for which the extent is the country of Malawi and the support for household resiliency is the third administrative level (Traditional Authorities) (4.4, F4) while the support for climate vulnerability is a raster grid (4.6, F5) with unknown spatial resolution.
The original study was conducted using STATA and ArcGIS, while this replication study will use The R Project for Statistical Computing.

## Study Design

The reproduction study design will first implement the original study as closely as possible to reproduce the 2010 Household Resilience map (figure 4) and Malawi Vulnerability Map (figure 5). We hypothesize that we will be able to exactly reproduce the same results for both maps.

### Original Study Design

The original study is an observational and descriptive multi-criteria analysis using geographic information systems (GIS) to implement a hierarchical design for a climate change vulnerability model of Malawi.
The model themes, indicators, and weights were selected based upon 70 interviews and 11 village focus groups from field trips in March and August of 2011 (1.4, 4.2, A1).
Themes and indicators were also contextualized in literature (3.3 through 3.7) and adjusted based on redundancy and representativeness across the country (4.3).
The model and weights were adjusted through "several iterations of the model usign alternative weighting schemes" to produce a "final product that reflects Malawi's contextual and perceptual vulnerability" (4.3).
Each theme was constructed of indicators from a single data provider: adaptive capacity is measured with USAID DHS surveys, livelihood sensitivity is measured with FEWSnet/MVAC livelihood zones baseline data, and physical exposure is measured with UNEP Global Risk Data Platform data (T1, T2). 
suggesting a model design based on a combination of factors including expert opinion, deductive theory, inductive data characteristics, and pragmatic data availability.

### Evaluating the Reproduction Results

In order to test the household resilience results, we will georeference the original figure 4 map using QGIS georeferencer plugin.
Using a vector dataset of traditional authorities and the georeferenced map, we will then use zonal statistics to extract the average brightness values, which represent four classes of household resilience, for each traditional authority.
After inspecting a histogram of the mean brightness values, we will reclassify the values as closely to the four classes on the original figure 4 as possible and then manually adjust the attribute values for any misclassified traditional authorities.
We will compare original and reproduction household resilience results by creating a confusion matrix, calculating the Spearman's Rho correlation coefficient (expecting a value of 1 for perfect positive correlation), and creating a thematic map of the difference between the original results and replication results.

In order to compare the Malawi vulnerability results, we will georeference the original figure 5 map using QGIS georeferencer plugin.
We will vectorize the UNEP-Grid raster  input most closely matching the published map and summarize the red, green, and blue brightness values of the original map using zonal statistics.
We will add the green and blue brightness values together to convert the original color ramp into a linear scale of continuous values. 
We will compare original and reproduction Malawi vulnerability results by creating a scatterplot, Spearman's Rho correlation coefficient (expecting a value near 1 for perfect positive correlation), and thematic map of the difference between the original results and replication results.

## Combining
- each meta data theme converted to Raster format `4.6`
- overall score calculated with map algebra `4.6`
- household resilience = adaptive capacity + livelihood sensitivity - physical exposure `4.6`
- final maps appears to be raster `F5`
- resilience scores are 203 traditional authority (polygons) `F4`
- "DHS Indicators were disaggregated to the village level" --> "combined @ a suitable administrative level for analysis" `4.4`
- "explanation on using survey data with GPS information is available from the DHS website and was instrumented this index" `4.4`
- Malawi contained 28 administrative districts (but too large - an "inappropriate scale for household vulnerability dynamics") `4.4` - hotspots of vulnerability would be lost
- "analysis of the weighted DHS vulnerability indicators was conducted at the administrative scale of Traditional Authorities"
- There are over 250 populated TAs in Malawi `4.4`
- "Not every traditional authority had surveys conducted within its administrative boundaries" `5.2`
- "TAs with missing information was indicated as 'Areas Missing DHS Data'" `5.2`
