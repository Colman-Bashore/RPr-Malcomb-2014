## Concepts
- Adaptive capacity as "household-level assets to recover from disasters and access to resources" 2.2
- Exposure: "magnitude and frequency of forced that could stress a system" 2.2
- Sensitivity: "degree to which a system will respond to an external disturbing force"
- Resilience: "ability of a household to prepare for, respond to and recover from complex drivers of vulnerability"

## Field Research Trips
- March 2011 1.4
- August 2011 1.4
- 70 interviews 1.4
- List of interviewed organizations is provided in Appendix 1 and referenced in section 3.2
- 11 village focus groups 1.4
- "multi-leveled, semi-structured interviews" 1.4
- interview themes: "perceptions of climate change, adaptation, governance, vulnerability, and foreign aid" 3.2
- "understanding household social and economic practices in the context of environmental uncertainty." 3.2

## Selecting and weighting indicators
- transcribe and code interviews 3.3
- synthesize into four metathemes 3.3
  - assets of land, livestock, income
  - access to markets, food, water, health care, and labor
  - livelihood sensitivity
  - physical exposure to droughts and floods
- themes (3.3) and indicators (3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7) contextualized in literature
- somewhere note collaboration with the DHS Survey folks and the FEWSNet folks as matter of convenience!
- Sources of Indicators (T1) and their weights (T2)
  - Assets: DHS Survey 20%
  - Access: DHS Survey 20%
  - Livelihood Sensitivity: Famine Early Warning Network 20%
  - Biophysical Exposure: UNEP/GRID-Europe 40%
- expert opinion of interviewees used to select and weight indicators 4.2
