## Concepts
- Adaptive capacity as "household-level assets to recover from disasters and access to resources" `2.2`
- Exposure: "magnitude and frequency of forced that could stress a system" `2.2`
- Sensitivity: "degree to which a system will respond to an external disturbing force"
- Resilience: "ability of a household to prepare for, respond to and recover from complex drivers of vulnerability"

## Field Research Trips
- March 2011 `1.4`
- August 2011 `1.4`
- 70 interviews `1.4`
- List of interviewed organizations is provided in Appendix 1 and referenced in section `3.2`
- 11 village focus groups `1.4`
- "multi-leveled, semi-structured interviews" `1.4`
- interview themes: "perceptions of climate change, adaptation, governance, vulnerability, and foreign aid" `3.2`
- "understanding household social and economic practices in the context of environmental uncertainty." `3.2`

## Selecting and weighting indicators
- transcribe and code interviews `3.3`
- synthesize into four metathemes `3.3`
  - assets of land, livestock, income
  - access to markets, food, water, health care, and labor
  - livelihood sensitivity
  - physical exposure to droughts and floods
- themes `3.3` and indicators `3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7` contextualized in literature
- somewhere note collaboration with the DHS Survey folks and the FEWSNet folks as matter of convenience!
- Sources of Indicators `T1` and their weights `T2`
  - Assets: DHS Survey 20%
  - Access: DHS Survey 20%
  - Livelihood Sensitivity: Famine Early Warning Network 20%
  - Biophysical Exposure: UNEP/GRID-Europe 40%
- expert opinion of interviewees used to select and weight indicators `4.2`

## Theory?

### Physical Exposure (3.7) -- same as next thing (same reference)
- UNEP Global Disaster Risk Platform
  - risks of flood (Peduzzi 2011)
  - drought exposure (Peduzzi 2012) based on 
    - global monthly gridded precipitation dataset from the Climactic Research Unit (Unviersity of E. Angolia)
    - global standardized precipitation index based on Brooklyn IRI Columbia
  - designed by: UNEP Global Resource Information Database (GRID) Europe

### Biophysical Exposure 40%
- Floods & rain variability, flood events `T1`
  - estimated risk for flood hazards 20% `T2`
  - Global estimated risk index for flood hazard `R w/ link`
- Drought & Dry Spells, drought indiices `T1`
  - exposition to drought events 20% `T2`
  - Physical exposition to drought events 1980 - 2001 `R w/ link`

### Livelihood Sensitivty 20% (3.6) 
- interviews with MVAC
- data created in partnership with FEWSNET & USAID
- pre-established livelihood zones - geographic areas where populations share characteristics of farming practices, labor, and enviro. coping strategies 
- May to July 2003 Household Economy Approach baseline survey in 11 livelihood zones
- wealth grroups created (poor, middle, better-off) in process unique to each zone
