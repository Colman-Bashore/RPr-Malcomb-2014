## Abstract 

Briefly describe the original analysis – type of study, research design, analytical approach, and results; motivation of the replication; and outline of the replication study

## Original Study Information

Description: Present a short narrative that summarizes key information about the original study. Include information about all of the following 
1.	Provide a written description of the study location and extent. Whenever possible, provide specific geographic coordinates bounding the study extent or a spatial reference file. 
2.	Identify and describe the spatial support (spatial resolution, unit of analysis) of the original analysis was conducted
3.	What type of sample/data did the original study use?
4.	Are the data and code used in the original analysis available/used in this replication?

### Data Description and Variables

Outline the data used in the study, including:

- sources of each data layer and
- the variable(s) used from each data source
- transformations applied to the variables (e.g. rescaling variables, calculating derived variables, aggregating to different geographic units, etc.)

This part may be compiled collaboratively as a group!

### Analytical Specification

The original study was conducted using ... and ... .
The replication study will use R.

## Materials and Procedure

**COPY YOUR WORKFLOW CONTENT HERE**

## Replication Results

For each output from the original study (mainly figure 4 and figure 5), present separately the results of the replication attempt. 

2.	State whether the original study was or was not supported by the replication
3.	State whether any hypothesis linked to a planned deviation from the original study was supported. Provide key statistics and related reasoning.

Figures to Include:
- map of resilience by traditional authority in 2010, analagous to figure 4 of the original study
- map of vulnerability in Malawi, analagous to figure 5 of the original study
- map of difference between your figure 4 and the original figure 4
- map of difference between your figure 5 and the original figure 5

## Unplanned Deviations from the Protocol

Summarize changes and uncertainties between
- your interpretation and plan for the workflow based on reading the paper
- your final workflow after accessing the data and code and completing the code

## Discussion

Provide a summary and interpretation of the key findings of the replication *vis-a-vis* the original study results. If the attempt was a failure, discuss possible causes of the failure. In this replication, any failure is probably due to practical causes, which may include:
- lack of data
- lack of code
- lack of details in the original analysis
- uncertainties due to manner in which data has been used

## Conclusion

Restate the key findings and discuss their broader societal implications or contributions to theory.
Do the research findings suggest a need for any future research?
